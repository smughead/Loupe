# Loupe

**Target elements, not screenshots.**

Loupe is a macOS accessibility inspector that generates AI-agent-ready output. I built this for myself to speed up Mac app development with Claude Code. Hopefully you find it useful too.

## What it does

- Inspect any UI element in any Mac app
- Annotate what you want changed
- Copy structured, agent-readable output
- Paste into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex — and watch them build

## How it works

**Hover** — Point at any element in any app and see accessibility info in real-time.

**Annotate** — Click an element, describe the change you want in plain English.

**Copy** — Hit the copy button to get structured output with element roles, hierarchy paths, and search patterns.

**Build** — Paste into your AI assistant. It knows exactly which element to target — no screenshots, no guessing.
